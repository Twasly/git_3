# Instruction for markdown

## Text formatting

To highlight the text in italics, you need to frame it with asterisks (*) or with underscore (_). For example, *this way* or _this way_.

To make the text bold, you need to frame it with double asterisks (**) or double underscore (__). For example, **this way** or __this way__.

Another ways of highlighting the text in italics or bold are necessary to combine both of these ways. For example, _the text may be in italics and **bold** at the same time_.

## Lists

To add unnumbered lists, you need to highlight the elements with asterisk (*). For example, this way:
* Element 1
* Element 2
* Element 3

To add numbered lists, you just need to number the elements. For example, this way:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

## Pictures

To add picture you need to write this: 
![Hi, this is dawn](e698f6a7083f4df3d1e3fc625dcf62c8.jpg)
