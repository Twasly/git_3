## Text formatting

To highlight the text in italics, you need to frame it with asterisks (*) or with underscore (_). For example, *this way* or _this way_.

To make the text bold, you need to frame it with double asterisks (**) or double underscore (__). For example, **this way** or __this way__.

Another ways of highlighting the text in italics or bold are necessary to combine both of these ways. For example, _the text may be in italics and **bold** at the same time_.
